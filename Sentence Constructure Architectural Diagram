# Sentence Constructor Architectural Diagram: 

# Business Case:

The organization will deploy a task force of 30 employees that are mid-level Japanese students. The team will be comprised of company Directors, Partners, Managing Consultants, Consultants, Business Analysts and Technical Subject Matter Experts.

# A no-code open-source GenAI solution.

# Risks, Assumptions & Constraints: 
# -	Risks 
#   o	AI assistant may not be well trained 
#   o	Limitations with the knowledge possessed by the AI assistant

# -	Assumptions 
#   o	The AI assistant has been trained on linguistics and cultural nuances 
#   o	AI assistant possesses the ability to help students learn when presented with a question 
# -	Constraints
#   o	Team members that will be using the chat bot may not have extensive experience with using AI prompts and may generate irrelevant or misleading responses

# Governance and Security: 
# -	As this is a federal agency, policies and procedures must be developed around the ingestion of PII and sensitive client information
